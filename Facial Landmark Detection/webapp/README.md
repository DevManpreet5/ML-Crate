## Facial Landmark Detection

### Goal 🎯
The main goal of this project is to provide a real-time facial landmark detection system. The application uses advanced computer vision techniques to identify and overlay facial landmarks on the user's face during a live video feed or on uploaded images. This can be useful for various applications including augmented reality, facial recognition, and more.

### Model(s) used for the Web App 🧮
The backend of this web application leverages the MediaPipe FaceMesh model for facial landmark detection. MediaPipe offers state-of-the-art speed and accuracy in detecting multiple facial landmarks across different face types. The application is built in Python using the Streamlit framework, facilitating a seamless integration of the ML model with the web interface.
