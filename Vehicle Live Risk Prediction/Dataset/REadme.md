# Live Vehicle Risk Prediction Dataset

## Overview

The Live Vehicle Risk Prediction Dataset is a comprehensive collection of data points aimed at predicting the risk associated with vehicles in various driving conditions. The dataset includes information on visibility, road surface conditions, weather, traffic density, road hazards, driver fatigue, medical conditions, speeding, and light conditions, among others.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Visibility**: Indicates the visibility level (e.g., Clear, Foggy, Rainy).
- **Road_Surface_Conditions**: Describes the state of the road surface (e.g., Dry, Wet, Icy).
- **Weather**: Weather conditions at the time of data collection (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Snowy).
- **Traffic_Density**: Density of traffic (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- **Road_Hazards**: Presence of any road hazards (e.g., None, Potholes, Debris).
- **Fatigue_Level**: Driver's level of fatigue (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
- **Medical_Condition**: Driver's medical condition (e.g., None, Mild, Severe).
- **Speeding**: Indicates if the vehicle was speeding (e.g., Yes, No).
- **Light_Conditions**: Lighting conditions during data collection (e.g., Daylight, Dusk, Night).

Additional columns may include:
- **Driver_Age**: Age of the driver.
- **Last_Service_Months_Ago**: Time since the vehicle was last serviced in months.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for building predictive models to assess vehicle risk under various conditions. It is suitable for machine learning applications such as classification and regression tasks aimed at improving vehicle safety and reducing accidents.
