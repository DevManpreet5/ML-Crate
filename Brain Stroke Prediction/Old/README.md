## **Brain Stroke Prediction** ##

## **Goal:** ##

To cleanse and analyse the course data to understand and draw insights from the given dataset and make models to get maximum contributions.

## **Dataset:** ##

 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset

## **Description:** ##
As the world is advancing more and more so are diseases, So is the case of Strokes. In this dataset we are set to analyse that.

## **What I Had Done:** ##
* Reading the data in python
* Basic Exploration of data
* Cleaning the data and transforming it to be useful for basic analysis 
* Visual Data exploration
* Making Models Based on the DataSet for Getting Maximum Accuracy.

## **Libraries Needed:** ##
* pandas - To manipulate dataframes
* seaborn - To visualise data
* matplotlib - To visualise data
* Sklearn - For Including ML Models
* Voting Classifier - A Voting Classifier is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models and predicts an output (class) based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.

## **Conclusions:** ##

* Lot of married guys are affected by brain stroke
* Most of them have never smoked in their life
* With this insight we're judging here,Females are more affected by brain strokes
* Most of them havent experienced HyperTension
* Most of have no heart disease
* Most of them work in Private Companies
* Most of the people who have Brain Stroke is living in Urban Region.
* Most of them have of around 78
* Training accuracy and Testing accuracy are pretty close to each other here,So there is no chance of overfitting here,Compared to standlone machine learning models,The ensemble approaches are slightly low,All the models giving some good accuracy here,Especically random forest and logistic regression
* Here the Accuracy Scores of All the Models:
